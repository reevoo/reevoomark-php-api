##Installation

Add Pearhub as a PEAR channel if you don't already have it:

```
pear channel-discover pearhub.org
```

Install the ReevooMark API:

```
pear install pearhub/reevoomark_php_api
```

##Implementation

Include the relevant CSS. For product reviews use:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://mark.reevoo.com/stylesheets/reevoomark/embedded_reviews.css" type="text/css" />
```

Include your customer specific Reevoo JavaScript:

``` html
<script src="http://mark.reevoo.com/reevoomark/<TRKREF>.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Include the PHP library (make sure you use the correct path to the reevoo_mark.php file):

``` php
<? include("reevoo_mark.php"); ?>
```

Render embedded review content. Make sure you replace `<reevoo_cache>` with the path of a directory that can be used to cache review content:

``` php
<? $reevoo_mark = new ReevooMark("<reevoo_cache>", "http://mark.reevoo.com/reevoomark/embeddable_reviews.html", "<TRKREF>", "<SKU>") ?>

<? if( $reevoo_mark->reviewCount() > 0 ){ ?>
  <?php $reevoo_mark->render(); ?>
<? }else{ ?>
  <h1>No reviews</h1>
<? } ?>
```

## Tracking

If you display the reviews in a tabbed display, or otherwise require visitors to your site to click an element before seeing the embedded reviews, add the following onclick attribute to track the clickthroughs:

``` html
  onclick="ReevooMark.track_click_through(‘<SKU>’)”
```

## Headers

By default, Reevoo will render a helpful page to the user when there are no reviews available. You can handle this yourself by checking the ```X-Reevoo-ReviewCount``` header.
