# reevoomark-php-api

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reevoo/reevoomark-php-api.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reevoo/reevoomark-php-api)

##Description

The reevoomark-php-api is a PHP tag library for Reevoo Ratings & Reviews customers who want to quickly and easily integrate Reevoo content in to their sites server-side.

##Other Languages
Tag libraries are also available for [.NET](https://github.com/reevoo/reevoomark-dotnet-api) and [Java](https://github.com/reevoo/reevoomark-java-api).

##Features

* Server-side inclusion of Reevoo content.
* Included CSS for display of Reevoo content.
* Server-side caching of content that respects the cache control rules set by Reevoo.

##Support
For Reevoo Ratings & Reviews customers, support can be obtained by emailing <operations@reevoo.com>.

There is also a [bug tracker](https://github.com/reevoo/reevoomark-php-api/issues) available.

##Installation

Get Composer from [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and install it.

Add the reevoo tag lib to your composer.json like so:

```
{
  "require": {
    "reevoo/reevoomark-php-api": "2.3.0"
  }
}
```

and then do:

```
$ php composer.phar install
```

##Implementation

Require the PHP library (make sure you use the correct path to the reevoo_mark.php file) and create new instance
of ReevooMark class with your TRKREF and path to your cache directory (or false if you do not want to use cache)
as a contructor attributes:

``` php
<?php
  require("vendor/reevoo/reevoomark-php-api/lib/reevoo_mark.php");
  $reevooMark = new ReevooMark("REV", "/tmp");
?>
```

ReevooMark supports multiple retailers content on the same page, it such case you can specify multiple TRKREFs
in the constructor:

``` php
<?php
  require("reevoo_mark.php");
  $reevooMark = new ReevooMark("REV1,REV2,REV3", "/tmp");
?>
```

To include the relevant CSS call the method ```cssAssets()``` inside ```<head>``` section of your page:

``` php
<head>
  ...
  <?php $reevooMark->cssAssets() ?>
</head>
```

To include the relevant JavaScript call the method ```javascriptAssets()``` before the closing ```</body>``` tag your page:

``` php
<body>
  ...
  <?php $reevooMark->javascriptAssets() ?>
</body>
```


### Alternate Implementation

The standard implementation calls echo internally so is less flexible if you want to use the data in contexts other than your pages.

Alternatively you may use the `ReevooMarkApi` class that works in a similar way to `ReevooMark` but returns values directly eg:

``` php
<?php
  require("reevoo_mark_api.php");
  $reevooMark = new ReevooMarkApi("REV", "/tmp");
  $reevooMark->cssAssets();
  //=> <link rel="stylesheet" href="//mark.reevoo.com/stylesheets/reevoomark/embedded_reviews.css" type="text/css" />
?>
```

If you would like to specify your own message you can pass attribute ```showEmptyMessage``` with value false
and use return value of the ```productReviews()``` method that is false in this case.

  <h2>Sorry, no product reviews here</h2>

If there are no offers to display you can display your own custom message as in the example below:

<?php $reevooMark->conversations(array("sku" => "100A", "trkref" => "REV")) ?>
```

If no conversations are available we will display default message in language specified by your ```locale```.
If you would like to specify your own message you can pass attribute ```showEmptyMessage``` with value false

## Tracking

If you display the reviews in a tabbed display, or otherwise require visitors to your site to click an element before
seeing the embedded reviews, add the following onclick attribute to track the clickthroughs:

If your trkref value is for example "REV" you would add:

```
onclick="ReevooMark_REV.track_click_through(‘<SKU>’)”
```

If your trkref value is for example "PIU" you would add:

```
onclick="ReevooMark_PIU.track_click_through(‘<SKU>’)”
```

See how in examples above you need to put your trkref value as a suffix to the ```ReevooMark_``` part. Also remember to replace ```<SKU>``` by the sku of the actual product.


### Purchase Tracking

If your site includes online shopping functionality you can use ```purchaseTrackingEvent()``` method on your "Order Confirmation Page".

``` php
<?php $reevooMark->purchaseTrackingEvent(array("skus" => "111,222,333", "value" => "250")) ?>
<?php $reevooMark->purchaseTrackingEvent(array("trkref" => "HYU", "skus" => "111,222,333", "value" => "250")) ?>
```

* ```skus``` attribute value is with a comma separated list of all the skus that have been purchased as part of the order.
* ```value``` attribute value is total price of the order, you don't need to include currency symbol.
* ```trkref``` attribute value you need to specify only if you are using multiple TRKREFs in ```ReevooMark``` constructor.

All this tracking information will be available to you on your Reevoo Analytics account.


### Propensity to Buy Tracking

This type of tracking is used as a substitute of purchase tracking for retailers that do not offer online purchase in their stores and therefore do not have an order confirmation page.

These retailers can use ```propensityToBuyTrackingEvent()``` method which can be added to any page they wish on the site.

``` php
<?php $reevooMark->propensityToBuyTrackingEvent(array("action" => "Brochure")) ?>
<?php $reevooMark->propensityToBuyTrackingEvent(array("trkref" => "REV", "action" => "Locate Store", "sku" => "123")) ?>
```

* ```action``` attribute value is the type of event that you want to track, can be anything you want like "user visited the buy now page" or "user requested brochure" or "user requested a test drive", etc...
* ```sku``` attribute is optional, you only have to include it if you want to link the tracking event to a specific product SKU
* ```trkref``` attribute value you need to specify only if you are using multiple TRKREFs in ```ReevooMark``` constructor.

All this tracking information will be available to you on your Google Analytics account.
